A hybrid role mixing a developer and a business analyst. This role aided me in understanding how the business ran internally. I aided in bringing the stakeholderâ€™s vision to reality and identifying future needs for the project I was assigned to while providing insightful knowledge on how our software operates from a code perspective.This role saw me host various Scrum meetings, communicating with multiple stakeholders and providing jargon-free solutions to upper management.
